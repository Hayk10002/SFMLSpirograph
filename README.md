# Intro
This is a program code for spirograph with innumerable nodes that draws whatever you want with [SFML](https://sfml-dev.org).

Òhat's where i got the idea for this project ---> <https://youtu.be/r6sGWTCMz2k>.

## Controls
There are two programs.
In first program you input a line you want the other program to draw.
After drawing a line
* **S** to save that line.
* **N** to delete that line and draw a new line.


Second program is spirograph that try to draw your line.
After one cicle the number of nodes of spirograph increasing by one and line that draws the spirograph starts look like to the line that you draw.
While spirograph is drawing
* **Rotate mouse wheel without pressing CTRL** to increase or decrease speed of spirograph.
* **Rotate mouse wheel with pressing CTRL** to zoom in or zoom out the canvas.
